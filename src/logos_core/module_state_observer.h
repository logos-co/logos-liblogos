// The module-lifecycle observer.
//
// The one place in liblogos that turns "a module changed state" into a
// structured, sequenced fact. Today load/unload/crash are spdlog::info lines
// and registry membership changes are silent, so every consumer polls.
//
// It does not talk to any module and does not know `modules_state` exists — it
// hands transitions to a SINK. With no sink installed this is nearly free:
// record() early-outs before it allocates or takes a lock, which matters
// because a host with no consumer is the normal case.
//
// ── RULE 1: NEVER DISPATCH UNDER loadMutex() ─────────────────────────────────
//
// The seam points run with ModuleManager's loadMutex() held. A sink that
// performs an RPC — which is exactly what the real one does — would then make a
// synchronous outbound call from inside the load path while holding the lock
// every other load and unload needs. That is the shape of two failures already
// paid for here: the ui-host startup token deadlock, and a ~417 s Basecamp
// stall from a synchronous call to a module that was not there.
//
// So: record() under the caller's lock buffers; flush() after releasing it
// dispatches. See ScopedModuleStateFlush.
//
// ── RULE 2: ONE SEQ COUNTER, FOR DELTAS AND SNAPSHOTS ────────────────────────
//
// modules_state applies a transition iff its seq beats what it stored for that
// module, and keeps a seq TOMBSTONE for one that left the listing. That puts a
// requirement on this side which is invisible from over there: snapshot record
// seqs must come from the SAME counter as transition seqs. Anything else makes
// the tombstone unreachably high (a real later delta dropped forever) or
// trivially low (a stale delta resurrecting a pruned module). nextSeq() is that
// counter and there is no other.
//
// THREAD SAFETY: load/unload run on whichever thread called the C API; a module
// DYING is detected on the container's background asio thread, not under
// loadMutex() at all. Every method here is safe from any thread.
