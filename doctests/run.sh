#
# Two specs run, each exercising THIS liblogos commit a different way:
#   - liblogos-module-runtime.test.yaml — drives liblogos through the headless
#     `logoscore` CLI frontend (build logoscore against this liblogos, install
#     test_basic_module, start the daemon, call methods).
#   - liblogos-as-a-library.test.yaml — embeds liblogos directly: builds
#     liblogos_core from this commit, compiles a small C++ program that links it,
#     installs modules with lgpm, and loads test_basic_module through the C API.
#
# The runner is the shared `doctest` CLI
# (https://github.com/logos-co/logos-doctest), invoked directly via its flake.
# `doctest run` executes every command in a temp directory and asserts on the
# output; `doctest generate` renders the same spec to Markdown under outputs/;
# `doctest clean` strips build artifacts so only the generated docs remain.
#
# To run against a local logos-doctest checkout instead of the published flake,
# set DOCTEST, e.g.:  DOCTEST="nix run path:../../logos-doctest --" ./run.sh
#
set -euo pipefail

# Run from this doctests/ directory regardless of where the script is invoked from.
